# Quantum Horizons: Modeling Extreme Galactic Phenomena in Computational Physics

# 1. Meaning and content of the project

# "The Edge of Infinity": 
Evokes the idea of studying phenomena at the boundaries of extreme objects, such as event horizons or quantum edges in galactic systems.
"Quantum Phenomena at Galactic Boundaries": Highlights the focus on quantum effects occurring at the outermost limits of supermassive black holes, neutron stars, and magnetars.The title captures both the scientific and the technical scope of modeling boundary-layer quantum mechanics using tools like MATLAB, COMSOL, and Qiskit.

# "Quantum Horizons": 
Retains the connection to black hole event horizons and quantum-scale exploration.
"Exploring the Edge of Infinity": Captures the boundary-layer phenomena at the extreme edges of galactic objects, blending with the concept of infinity.

# Tools used are:
1. Qiskit for quantum circuit simulation and signal detection in quantum channels, 
2. Documentation on Supermassive Black Holes, Magnetars, and Neutron Stars can inspire fascinating projects. Below, I'll expand on the ideas of this project in English, providing additional examples in Qiskit and HDL (Hardware Description Language).
