‚ú® Meaning and Content of the Project
The Edge of Infinity
Evokes the idea of studying phenomena at the boundaries of extreme objects, such as event horizons or quantum edges in galactic systems.

Quantum Phenomena at Galactic Boundaries: Focuses on quantum effects occurring at the outermost limits of supermassive black holes, neutron stars, and magnetars. The title captures both the scientific and the technical scope of modeling boundary-layer quantum mechanics using tools like MATLAB, COMSOL, and Qiskit.

Quantum Horizons
Retains the connection to black hole event horizons and quantum-scale exploration.

Exploring the Edge of Infinity: Captures the boundary-layer phenomena at the extreme edges of galactic objects, blending with the concept of infinity.

üß∞ Tools Used
Qiskit: For quantum circuit simulation and signal detection in quantum channels.

Documentation: On Supermassive Black Holes, Magnetars, and Neutron Stars can inspire fascinating projects. Below, I'll expand on the ideas of this project in English, providing additional examples in Qiskit and HDL (Hardware Description Language).

C Example (GPIO):

LQFP64

Visual Integration in Qiskit Metal: The adjusted Qiskit Metal visualization will dynamically reflect gravitational wave disturbances.

CPW meanders will stretch or shrink based on wave amplitude.

Pad dimensions can shift slightly to represent quantum system adjustments.

Final Integration with Previous LIDAR Plan: This expanded black hole signal detection aligns with the previously described LIDAR systems.

üî¨ C/VHDL Sensors
Accelerometers: Detect physical disturbances caused by gravitational waves.

Quantum Algorithms: Shor‚Äôs algorithm models signal interference.

Actuators: Stepper motors adjust optical components for enhanced detection.

LIDAR Design: Real-time adjustment of CPWs and photon paths simulates black hole signal detection.

This approach combines astrophysical simulation with practical quantum and LIDAR technologies to develop a robust signal detection and processing system.

üîç Example COMSOL Simulation

COMSOL Code Example
matlab
% Initialize COMSOL Model
model = comsol.ModelUtil.create('Model');
model.modelPath('C:\COMSOL\MagneticFieldSimulation');

% Create 3D geometry (sphere to represent material)
geom1 = model.geom.create('geom1', 3);
geom1.feature.create('sph1', 'Sphere');
geom1.feature('sph1').set('r', '1e-3'); % Radius in meters

% Define material properties (using air and iron for example)
mat1 = model.material.create('mat1', 'Common');
mat1.propertyGroup('def').set('mu', {'1', '1e-5'}); % Relative permeability

% Add Magnetic Fields (mf) physics
mf = model.physics.create('mf', 'MagneticFields', 'geom1');
mf.feature.create('f1', 'MagneticField', 3);
mf.feature('f1').set('B0', [0, 0, 1e5]); % Uniform magnetic field in z-direction

% Set boundary conditions (magnetic insulation on boundary)
mf.feature.create('b1', 'Boundary', 2);
mf.feature('b1').set('BoundaryType', 'MagneticInsulation');

% Mesh the geometry
mesh1 = model.mesh.create('mesh1', 'geom1');
mesh1.autoMeshSize(2); % Set mesh size for better accuracy

% Run the simulation
study1 = model.study.create('std1');
study1.feature.create('stat', 'Stationary');
study1.run;

% Plot the magnetic field results
model.result.create('pg1', 'PlotGroup3D');
model.result('pg1').create('surf1', 'Surface');
model.result('pg1').feature('surf1').set('expr', 'mf.B');
model.result('pg1'
